#README

PLEASE READ.
We had great projects for our application, but due to time constraints and more importantly because of our lack of skill and experience in web programming (neither of us ever actually learnt javascript or html), the application is far from completed.
This is what is missing and we would have implemented if we had more time:
- a page to search for genes and diseases related by the same genes. If you look at the code you will see that we have a draft, but it's not working yet;
- some graphic design and a better formatting;
- a description for every interaction;
- and more.

We're still learning but we did our best.

Quick checklist on how to run the application:
* `stardog-admin server start --disable-security` (the application assumes a database called "interdrugs")
* `virtualenv .` in the repository directory
* `source bin/activate` 
* `cd src`
* `python server.py`
